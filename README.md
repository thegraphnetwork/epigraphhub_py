Epigraphhub Python package

</div>

The *EpiGraphHub library* is designed to provide external users with all of the analytical functionality used to power the [EpiGraphHub platform](https://epigraphhub.org/superset/welcome/) and its applications. In fact, all applications designed to run on the EpiGraphHub platform rely heavily on it.
This library should be used by users that want to contribute to the platform as well as by users that want to borrow some of the tools developed by our team in other opensource projects.
The EpiGraphHub library is also available for the [R](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/r-epigraphhub/blob/main/epigraphhub.Rproj) language.

EpiGraphHub library allows users make and apply:

‚óè Bayesian Statistics
‚óè Epidemiological analysis
‚óè Mathematical modelling
‚óè Cost-effectiveness analysis
‚óè Forecasting
‚óè Machine Learning
‚óè Text Mining
‚óè Geo-Spatial analysis

## Installation

The EpigraphHub library can be installed using pip:

`$ pip install epigraphhub`

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you‚Äôre ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.
