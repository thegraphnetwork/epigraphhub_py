Epigraphhub Python package

</div>

The *EpiGraphHub library* is designed to provide external users with all of the analytical functionality used to power the [EpiGraphHub platform](https://epigraphhub.org/superset/welcome/) and its applications. In fact, all applications designed to run on the EpiGraphHub platform rely heavily on it.

This library should be used by users that want to contribute to the platform as well as by users that want to borrow some of the tools developed by our team in other opensource projects.

EpiGraphHub library allows users make and apply:

- Bayesian Statistics
- Epidemiological analysis
- Mathematical modelling
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Forecasting
- Machine Learning
- Text Mining
- Geo-Spatial analysis

The EpiGraphHub library is also available for the [R](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/r-epigraphhub/blob/main/epigraphhub.Rproj) language.

## Installation

The EpigraphHub library can be installed using pip:

```
$ pip install epigraphhub
